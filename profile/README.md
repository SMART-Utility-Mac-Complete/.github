## Overview

SMART Utility provides Mac users with professional-grade disk health monitoring that reveals drive condition invisible to standard macOS tools. The application analyzes SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) data that drives maintain internally, interpreting technical indicators into actionable health assessments that enable proactive response before drive failure causes data loss emergencies.

SMART data analysis decodes the diagnostic information drives collect about their own operation, including error counts, temperature history, wear indicators, and reliability predictions. This self-monitoring exists on all modern drives but requires specialized software to access meaningfully. SMART Utility makes this data useful for users who don't have deep technical knowledge of drive diagnostics.

Health status presentation translates complex SMART attributes into clear overall assessments showing drive condition at a glance. Traffic-light style indicators communicate health immediately while detailed views explain specific concerns requiring attention. The presentation serves both quick verification and deep investigation needs.

SSD-specific monitoring addresses the unique health considerations that solid-state drives present, including wear leveling status, write amplification, and remaining lifespan estimation based on write endurance. SSDs fail differently than spinning drives, requiring specialized analysis that SMART Utility provides appropriately.

Hard drive monitoring tracks traditional spinning disk health including reallocated sectors, pending sectors, spin retry counts, and mechanical performance indicators that predict physical drive failure. The HDD monitoring catches developing problems while drives remain operational and data remains recoverable.
